In this question, array nums1 is of provided size "m" but its original size is "m+n".
Except for the first "m" elements initially rest elements are "0", so they are not counted.
We have to merge both arrays and replace the "0s" in the array nums1 that are beyond the "m" size of the array nums1 with the elements of nums2.
Lastly, sort the nums1 array to get the sorted array.
